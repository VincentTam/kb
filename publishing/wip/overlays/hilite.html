				<p>When text is synchronized during playback, it can also be styled to make it more obvious which passage is
					being narrated. EPUB 3 allows you to define the CSS class to apply to the active element in the package
					document metadata using the special <code class="property">media:active-class</code> property:</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;meta property="media:active-class">
   -epub-overlay-active
&lt;/meta></code></pre>

				<p>In this case, the reading system will check all attached CSS files for a class named <code class="value"
						>-epub-overlay-active</code> and will apply whatever styles are defined in it to each synchronized
					element for the duration of its playback</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p class="label">Note</p>
					<p>The name that you use for the CSS class is not important. It can be any name you choose, but for
						clarity a name that indicates its purpose is recommended.</p>
				</div>

				<p>For example, to apply a yellow background to the active text a basic rule such as the following could be
					created:</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code class="language-css">.-epub-overlay-active {
   background-color: rgb(255,255,0);
}</code></pre>

				<p>Be aware when applying background shading that it may not contrast well with text colors you've already
					assigned. If the shading will cause insufficient contrast in some situations, consider also specifying a
					default color:</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code class="language-css">.-epub-overlay-active {
   color: rgb(0,0,0);
   background-color: rgb(255,255,0);
}</code></pre>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<dl class="faq">
					<dt>Can I only use background shading with overlays?</dt>
					<dd><p>No, you can make any changes to the active text, but be aware that the choices you make may impact
							on the accessibility of the publication.</p>
						<p>Also consider the ebook medium. Increasing the font size might seem to be a good choice to make
							the active text more pronounced, but the practical result may be text that jumps around on the
							page. As one paragraph loses focus, for example, its text size will shrink and the next will
							increase, causing the layout to "move" on the user. It may also be the case that text that was
							visible when the page was originally rendered will get pushed out of the viewport as the new
							highlighting is applied.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Can I highlight words within sentences (or within paragraphs) using overlays?</dt>
					<dd><p>Yes and no. If you are using pre-recorded audio, you cannot. The playback will only be as granular
							as your overlay file, as highlighting is applied to each <code>par</code> in turn.</p>
						<p>Highlighting at both the sentence and word level is common in reading systems that provide
							text-to-speech playback. This rendering is typical a combination of heuristic lookaheads to
							determine each sentence (or part of a sentence) combined with word-level highlighting as each
							word is fed to the TTS engine for rendering.</p>
						<p>Overlays can take advantage of TTS playback to offer similar functionality, but at the price of
							audio quality (synthesized voices) and assurance that the content will render (not all reading
							systems provide TTS voicing). If no <code>audio</code> element is provided in a <code>par</code>,
							the reading system is expected to render text content synthetically (audio/video content
							referenced from the <code>text</code> element would be initiated). Any word-by-word highlighting
							offered by the TTS engine would compliment the active overlay highlighting.</p>
						<p>But choosing this kind of playback is suboptimal for the pitfalls already listed and because of
							the further conflicts that may arise between the highlighting you apply and the highlighting the
							reading system applies during TTS playback. Color clashes could make the text illegible for
							users.</p>
						<p>When mixing overlays and TTS technologies is necessary (e.g., to narrate the body and
							synthetically render indexes and other tedious to narrate backmatter), it's best to err on the
							side of a simple highlighting scheme for the overlays.</p>
