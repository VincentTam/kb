				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
				
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt>What if the order of my ebook doesn't exactly match the order of the print
						equivalent?</dt>
					<dd><p>It is sometimes the case when converting to digital that front and back matter material gets
						shuffled around and/or omitted. These changes in content order are not unexpected, and users
						will understand that their ebooks may not be formatted exactly the same way as the print, and may
						not include all the print content.</p>
						<p>If you do make changes to the content order, do not renumber the existing pagination to return it
							to sequential order. The purpose of page list navigation is to get the user to the equivalent
							point, not to be sequentially correct.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Does the page number reflect the page that is ending or the page that is
						starting?</dt>
					<dd><p>The page number always reflects the page that is starting.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Does the page break marker placement follow the print position?</dt>
					<dd><p>No, page break markers are always placed at the start of the page's content, regardless of whether
						the page number is printed at the top or bottom of the page in the print edition. When a user
						jumps to a specific page, they want to jump to the start of the content for that page, not the
						end.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Should I include the page numbers as content or empty elements?</dt>
					<dd><p>There are pros and cons to each approach.</p>
						<p>If you include the page numbers as text content within a <code>span</code> or <code>div</code>,
							the pages will be more easily accessible to both sighted users and users using assistive
							technologies. This method has been employed in previous DAISY standards. The potential downside,
							however, is that mainstream user agents will not provide equivalent functionality to turn off
							unwanted content, forcing users to hear and view the page numbers.</p>
						<p>Page numbers as empty elements are the more traditional mainstream approach, with anchor tags
							having served this function in the past. Using the <code>aria-label</code> attribute on an empty
							element, however, limits the users who will have access to the page number while reading.</p>
						<p>Although user agents don't support toggling the visibility of page numbers, it is possible
							to provide the functionality using JavaScript. A script could be included in each document to
							show/hide the numbers.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Where do I put a page number when the page break occurs in the middle of a
						list?</dt>
					<dd><p>Lists often break across pages, with one item ending at the bottom of one and a new item starting
						at the top of the next. In these cases, it is not possible to locate the page number between the
						two list items, as it is not valid for a list to contain anything but list items.</p>
						<p>The obvious solutions are to either insert the page number as the very last element in the item
							that ends the page:</p>
						<pre><code>&lt;li>&#8230;.&lt;span
     epub:type="pagebreak"
    
     title="24"/>&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>&#8230;&lt;/li>
</code></pre>
						<p>or to place it as the very first element in the list item that starts the page</p>
						<pre><code>&lt;li>&#8230;.&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>&lt;span
     epub:type="pagebreak"
    
     title="24"/>&#8230;&lt;/li>
</code></pre>
						<p>One practice to avoid is creating a new list item just for the page break. As page breaks are
							often not visible content, an empty list item will be confusing to all users and may alter the
							meaning of the list.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Can I use <code>a</code> tags for page numbers?</dt>
					<dd><p>The <code>a</code> element has two specific uses defined in HTML5: for links when the
						<code>href</code> attribute is present, and for placeholder links when it is not (e.g., a
						link that might be active in another context or after some interaction by the user). As page
						breaks are not links, and are never intended to be activated as links, it is  incorrect to 
						use them for page breaks markers.</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>If a reflowable publication is derived from a statically-paginated source, such as a print edition, including
					a page list allows users to coordinate positions. For example, a student using a digital edition in a class
					where her peers are using print books would be able to jump to the same pages during instruction.</p>
				
				<p>The page list itself is a list of links to all the page breaks locations. User agents can use this list to
					provide automatic page jump functionality, or a user can access it directly to manually select the page they
					wish to go to.</p>
				
				<p>If a digital publication is produced from the same workflow as a print document, page break locations should also be
					retained (although a page list can be created without explicit page break markers so long as there is some anchor for
					the link to go to). Page break locations can be added to the markup using <code>span</code> and <code>div</code> tags with a
					<code>role</code> attribute set to the value <code>doc-pagebreak</code>. To hide the page number from
					visual viewing, the <code>aria-label</code> attribute can be used to identify the number.</p>
				
				<p>An <code>id</code> attribute has to be attached to each page break location to enable 
					linking to the breaks.</p>
				
				<p>Identifying the source of the pagination in the publication metadata is also important to help users determine the 
					usability of the pagination (e.g., will it match the print edition being used in a class). This source is typically
					identified using a <code>dc:source</code> element.</p>
				
				<div class="note">
					<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some publishers include a page list and/or page break markers in digital publications 
						without paginated equivalents. In these cases, the identifier of the current publication could be identified
						as the source to avoid confusion and/or the lack of a source could be noted in an accessibility summary.</p>
				</div>
				
				<section>
					<h4>EPUB 2</h4>
					
					<p>In EPUB 2, a page list is expressed using the
						<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0.1_draft.htm#Section2.4.1.2"><code>pageList</code> element</a>
						in the NCX file. It is not possible to include a semantic that identifies page break locations in the content,
						as XHTML 1.1 does not support either the ARIA <code>role</code> or <code>epub:type</code> attributes.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h4>EPUB 3</h4>
					
					<p>In EPUB 3, the page list is included in the navigation document and identified with the <code>epub:type</code> value
						<code>page-list</code>.</p>
